### `drive_customers`
Customer information, but not a person but a **connection** basis.

`drive_customers` is an entity that literally embodies the information
of those who participated in the drive system as customers. By the way,
the `drive_customers` does not mean a person, but a **connection** basis.
Therefore, even if the same person connects to the drive system multiple,
multiple records are created in `drive_customers`.

The first purpose of this is to track the customer's inflow path in detail,
and it is for cases where the same person enters as a non-member, reads a
[repository file](#drive_repository_files) in advance, and registers/logs
in at the moment for modification. It is the second. Lastly, it is to
accurately track the activities that a person performs at the drive system
in various ways like below.

- Same person comes from an [external service](#drive_external_users)
- Same person creates multiple [accounts](#drive_members)
- Same person makes a download with only [real name authentication](#drive_citizens)

Therefore, `drive_customers` can have multiple records with the same
[drive_citizens](#drive_citizens), [drive_members](#drive_members), and [drive_external_users](#drive_external_users).
Additionally, if a customer signs up for membership after verifying their real
name or signs up for our service after being a user of an external service,
all related records are changed at once. Therefore, identification and tracking
of customers can be done very systematically.

**Properties**
  - `id`: Primary Key.
  - `drive_member_id`: Belonged member's [drive_members.id](#drive_members)
  - `drive_external_user_id`: Belonged external service user's [drive_external_users.id](#drive_external_users)
  - `drive_citizen_id`: Belonged citizen's [drive_citizens.id](#drive_citizens)
  - `href`
    > Connection URL.
    > 
    > [window.location.href](#window)
  - `referrer`
    > Referrer URL.
    > 
    > [window.document.referrer](#window)
  - `ip`: IP address,
  - `created_at`
    > Creation time of record.
    > 
    > It means the time when the customer connected to the drive system.

### `drive_external_users`
External user information.

`drive_external_users` is an entity dsigned for when this system needs
to connect with external services and welcome their users as customers of
this service.

For reference, customers who connect from an external service must have
this record, and the external service user is identified through the two
attributes `application` and `uid`. If a customer connected from an
external service completes [real-name authentication](#drive_citizens)
from this service, each time the external service user reconnects to this
service and issues a new [customer](#drive_customers) authentication
token, [real-name authentication](#drive_citizens) begins with
completed.

And `password` is the password issued to the user by the external service
system (the so-called permanent user authentication token), and is never
the actual user password. However, for customers who entered the same
`application` and `uid` as the current external system user, this is to
determine whether to view this as a correct external system user or a
violation.

In addition, additional information received from external services can
be recorded in the `data` field in JSON format.

**Properties**
  - `id`: Primary Key.
  - `application`
    > Identifier code of the external service.
    > 
    > It can be same with [drive_channels.code](#drive_channels) in common.
  - `uid`: Identifier key of external user from the external system.
  - `nickname`: Nickname of external user in the external system.
  - `data`: Additional information about external user from the external system.
  - `password`
    > Password of external user from the external system.
    > 
    > This is a password issued to the user by an external service, and is
    > by no means the actual user password. However, for customers who
    > entered the same application and code as the current external system
    > user, this is to determine whether to view this as a correct external
    > system user or a violation.
  - `created_at`
    > Creation time of record.
    > 
    > Another word, first time when the external user connected.

### `drive_citizens`
Citizen verification information.

`drive_citizens` is an entity that records the user's real name and
mobile input information.

For reference, in South Korea, real name authentication is required for
[employeed](#drive_enterprise_employees) people, so the `name` attribute
is important. However, the situation is different overseas, so in reality,
`mobile` attributes are the most important, and identification of individual
users is also done based on this mobile.

Of course, real name and mobile phone authentication information are
encrypted and stored.

**Properties**
  - `id`: Primary Key.
  - `mobile`: Mobile phone number.
  - `name`: Real name, or equivalent name identifiable.
  - `created_at`
    > Creation time of record.
    > 
    > In other words, the 1st time of citizen activation.
  - `deleted_at`: Deletion time of record.

### `drive_members`
Member Account.

`drive_members` is an entity that symbolizes the case when a user
signs up as a member of this system.

For reference, it is possible to travel other public
[repositories](#drive_repositories) without joining membership. Otherwise,
if you want to create your own repository or participate into some
[enterprise](#drive_enterprises) as an
[employee](#drive_enterprise_employees), you must join as a member.

**Properties**
  - `id`: Primary Key.
  - `drive_account_id`: Belonged account's [drive_accounts.id](#drive_accounts)
  - `drive_citizen_id`: Belonged citizen's [drive_citizens.id](#drive_citizens)
  - `nickname`: Nickname.
  - `password`: Password for log-in.
  - `created_at`
    > Creation time of record.
    > 
    > In other words, the joining time.
  - `updated_at`: Update time of record.
  - `withdrawn_at`: Deletion time of record.

### `drive_member_emails`
Email address of member.

This system allows multiple email addresses to be registered for one
[member](#drive_members). If you don't have to plan such multiple
email addresses, just use only one.

**Properties**
  - `id`: 
  - `drive_member_id`: Belonged member's [drive_members.id](#drive_members)
  - `value`: Email address.
  - `created_at`: Creation time of record.

### `drive_accounts`
Account entity.

`drive_accounts` is an entity that represents the accounts of the drive
system. An account is a subject unit with a unique identifier code and can
own storage, etc. For example, if the address of a specific repository on
GitHub is https://github.com/samchon/typia, "samchon" is the account
identifier and the owner of the repository called "typia".

And the account referred to here does not necessarily refer to a person. This
is because the account holder may be a [member](#drive_members), but it
may also be an [enterprise](#drive_enterprises). For example, in the case
of https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript, the account owner is not a person,
but Microsoft, an enterprise.

In addition, an account can change its owner. And when changing ownership, it
is also possible for the entity to change from an individual to an enterprise.
For example, this may be the case when an account or repository that started
as an individual becomes successful and is promoted to an enterprise in the
future.

**Properties**
  - `id`: Primary Key.
  - `code`: Identifer code of the account.
  - `created_at`: Creation time of record.
  - `deleted_at`: Deletion time of record.

### `drive_enterprises`
Enterprise, a enterprise entity.

drive_enterprises is an entity that symbolizes an enterprise, and literally
refers to the subjects participating in the drive system on a enterprise basis.
And in the case of enterprise, unlike [member](#drive_members), it must
have an [account](#drive_accounts).

Enterprises also have as sub-entities [employees](#drive_enterprise_employees)
and [teams](#drive_enterprise_teams) composed of them. And among these,
a team can have its [companions](#drive_enterprise_team_companions)
collectively have the same [access rights](#drive_repository_accesses) to
enterprise [repositories](#drive_repositories).

**Properties**
  - `id`: Primary Key.
  - `drive_account_id`: Belonged account's [drive_accounts.id](#drive_accounts)
  - `name`: Representative name of the enterprise.
  - `created_at`: Creation time of record.
  - `updated_at`: Update time of record.
  - `deleted_at`: Deletion time of record.

### `drive_enterprise_employees`
Employee entity within a enterprise.

`drive_enterprise_employees` is an entity that represents employees belonging
to an [enterprise](#drive_enterprises). Employees work as part of each
[team](#drive_enterprise_teams) within the enterprise, and are granted
[accessibility](#drive_repository_accesses) on a team-by-team basis from
the enterprise's repository.

Please note that only those who have registered as [members](#drive_members)
of this drive system can be
[appointed](#drive_enterprise_employee_appointments) as employees, and it
is possible for one person to belong to multiple enterprises as an employee at
the same time.

**Properties**
  - `id`: Primary Key.
  - `drive_enterprise_id`: Belonged enterprise's [drive_enterprises.id](#drive_enterprises)
  - `drive_member_id`: Belonged member's [drive_members.id](#drive_members)

`drive_enterprise_employee_appointments` is an entity that embodies the history
of appointment and position change information of
[employees](#drive_enterprise_employees) within the
[enterprise](#drive_enterprises).

Therefore, this entity record is created once when a enterprise appoints
an employee, and is accumulated each time the employee changes his or her
position thereafter.

[employees](#drive_enterprise_employees) are participating as companion in
each [team](#drive_enterprise_teams) that makes up the enterprise.

For reference, employees participate as companion of a team and are assigned
some kind of role, which may be different from their original position.
Additionally, it is possible for employees to belong to multiple teams at the
same time. This is similar to how it was possible for one member to be
[appointed](#drive_enterprise_employee_appointments) as an employee at
multiple enterprises at the same time.

**Properties**
  - `id`: Primary Key.
  - `drive_enterprise_team_id`: Belonged team's [drive_enterprise_teams.id](#drive_enterprise_teams)

### `drive_customers`
Customer information, but not a person but a **connection** basis.

`drive_customers` is an entity that literally embodies the information
of those who participated in the drive system as customers. By the way,
the `drive_customers` does not mean a person, but a **connection** basis.
Therefore, even if the same person connects to the drive system multiple,
multiple records are created in `drive_customers`.

The first purpose of this is to track the customer's inflow path in detail,
and it is for cases where the same person enters as a non-member, reads a
[repository file](#drive_repository_files) in advance, and registers/logs
in at the moment for modification. It is the second. Lastly, it is to
accurately track the activities that a person performs at the drive system
in various ways like below.

- Same person comes from an [external service](#drive_external_users)
- Same person creates multiple [accounts](#drive_members)
- Same person makes a download with only [real name authentication](#drive_citizens)

Therefore, `drive_customers` can have multiple records with the same
[drive_citizens](#drive_citizens), [drive_members](#drive_members), and [drive_external_users](#drive_external_users).
Additionally, if a customer signs up for membership after verifying their real
name or signs up for our service after being a user of an external service,
all related records are changed at once. Therefore, identification and tracking
of customers can be done very systematically.

**Properties**
  - `id`: Primary Key.
  - `drive_member_id`: Belonged member's [drive_members.id](#drive_members)
  - `drive_external_user_id`: Belonged external service user's [drive_external_users.id](#drive_external_users)
  - `drive_citizen_id`: Belonged citizen's [drive_citizens.id](#drive_citizens)
  - `href`
    > Connection URL.
    > 
    > [window.location.href](#window)
  - `referrer`
    > Referrer URL.
    > 
    > [window.document.referrer](#window)
  - `ip`: IP address,
  - `created_at`
    > Creation time of record.
    > 
    > It means the time when the customer connected to the drive system.

### `drive_external_users`
External user information.

`drive_external_users` is an entity dsigned for when this system needs
to connect with external services and welcome their users as customers of
this service.

For reference, customers who connect from an external service must have
this record, and the external service user is identified through the two
attributes `application` and `uid`. If a customer connected from an
external service completes [real-name authentication](#drive_citizens)
from this service, each time the external service user reconnects to this
service and issues a new [customer](#drive_customers) authentication
token, [real-name authentication](#drive_citizens) begins with
completed.

And `password` is the password issued to the user by the external service
system (the so-called permanent user authentication token), and is never
the actual user password. However, for customers who entered the same
`application` and `uid` as the current external system user, this is to
determine whether to view this as a correct external system user or a
violation.

In addition, additional information received from external services can
be recorded in the `data` field in JSON format.

**Properties**
  - `id`: Primary Key.
  - `application`
    > Identifier code of the external service.
    > 
    > It can be same with [drive_channels.code](#drive_channels) in common.
  - `uid`: Identifier key of external user from the external system.
  - `nickname`: Nickname of external user in the external system.
  - `data`: Additional information about external user from the external system.
  - `password`
    > Password of external user from the external system.
    > 
    > This is a password issued to the user by an external service, and is
    > by no means the actual user password. However, for customers who
    > entered the same application and code as the current external system
    > user, this is to determine whether to view this as a correct external
    > system user or a violation.
  - `created_at`
    > Creation time of record.
    > 
    > Another word, first time when the external user connected.

### `drive_citizens`
Citizen verification information.

`drive_citizens` is an entity that records the user's real name and
mobile input information.

For reference, in South Korea, real name authentication is required for
[employeed](#drive_enterprise_employees) people, so the `name` attribute
is important. However, the situation is different overseas, so in reality,
`mobile` attributes are the most important, and identification of individual
users is also done based on this mobile.

Of course, real name and mobile phone authentication information are
encrypted and stored.

**Properties**
  - `id`: Primary Key.
  - `mobile`: Mobile phone number.
  - `name`: Real name, or equivalent name identifiable.
  - `created_at`
    > Creation time of record.
    > 
    > In other words, the 1st time of citizen activation.
  - `deleted_at`: Deletion time of record.

### `drive_members`
Member Account.

`drive_members` is an entity that symbolizes the case when a user
signs up as a member of this system.

if you want to create your own repository or participate into some
[enterprise](#drive_enterprises) as an
[employee](#drive_enterprise_employees), you must join as a member.

### `drive_accounts`
Account entity.

`drive_accounts` is an entity that represents the accounts of the drive
system. An account is a subject unit with a unique identifier code and can
own storage, etc. For example, if the address of a specific repository on
GitHub is https://github.com/samchon/typia, "samchon" is the account
identifier and the owner of the repository called "typia".

And the account referred to here does not necessarily refer to a person. This
is because the account holder may be a [member](#drive_members), but it
may also be an [enterprise](#drive_enterprises). For example, in the case
of https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript, the account owner is not a person,
but Microsoft, an enterprise.

In addition, an account can change its owner. And when changing ownership, it
is also possible for the entity to change from an individual to an enterprise.
For example, this may be the case when an account or repository that started
as an individual becomes successful and is promoted to an enterprise in the
future.
